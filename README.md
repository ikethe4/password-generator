# Password Generator
## Overview

Unique passwords free of obvious ties to the user are a vital part of cyber security.  It is with this in mind that this password generator becomes a valuable tool.  The user can select a number of different elements he/she would like his/her password to contain.  The user can select how long they would like their password to be and if they would like it to contain:

* Unique symbols
* Lower case characters
* Upper Case characters
* Numbers

After the criteria is selected, a random password is generated in the text box on the page.  By truly randomizing the password, this generator helps ensure a strong, unguessable password.
